	"quality_estimation_desc": "The quality estimation is based on the abilities you have selected for the chosen weapon. It is important to note that the meter is not necessarily judging the quality of the input, but rather estimating the quality of the models output.\n\nAbilities that the model predicts as \"bad\" for the chosen weapon will have an exponential negative effect on the quality estimation.\nSimilarly, the less Ability Points you have remaining, the more strict the quality estimation will become, because you are \"boxing in\" the model.\n\nSelecting fewer than 2 sub abilities will always result in a lower quality estimation, because the model is less confident in its prediction.",
	"output_overriding": "Output Overriding",
	"output_overriding_desc": "The algorithm for the output has authority over the input and will move abilities to different slots or split main abilities into sub abilities if it deems it necessary. This is done to prevent locking out certain main abilities from being assigned to the output.\n\nFor example, if you put a main of Swimspeed into the Head slot, and the model predicts Comeback as the output, then the Swimspeed will either be moved to a different main slot if available, or split into three sub abilities.",
